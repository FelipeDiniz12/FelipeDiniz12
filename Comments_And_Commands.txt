OTHER COMMANDS

$ git add *.<extension>  // add every file with this certain extension to the branch. To remove every file with the same extension, it's the same stuff, just write the command below:
$ git rm --cached *.<extension>


$ git add . // this command makes EVERY file in ur directory to be added to the branch. 

$ clear // clear the blackscreen

$ touch .gitignore  // create a file in the directory that can be used to define which files wouldn't be added to the branch. Just type inside this file the <file_name>.<extension> of the file that u don't want to get added to the branch. U can do it also with directories inside ur head one just adding "/<directory_name>" inside the file ".gitignore". The command *.<extension> works also to ignore every file with an given extension.

$ touch <file_name>.<extension> // creates a file with certain extension
ex.: $ touch index.html
$ touch app.js

$ git branch <BranchName> // create a branch 

COMMENTS

If u have ur <file_name>.<extension> already added into the branch, and provide some modification, without adding the file again to the branch, when u type the command "$ git status", u gonna see that u have ur old project into the branch, but the new one it's now uploaded.

When u type the command "$ git commit", a new window will open, and to type on it u need to press "i" button. Then u r free to type into it.


"#" is understanding as comment for git

To get outta the type(insert) mode, just press escape(ESC)

To get outta of this new window, after ESC, type ":wq" and then ENTER

If u don't wanna to get into that new window when u r commiting some files, just type "$ git commit -m 'Some comment'", and then ur file's gonna be uploaded without openning the new screen.
